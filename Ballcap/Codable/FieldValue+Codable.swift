 * A protocol describing the encodable properties of a Timestamp.

 * Note: this protocol exists as a workaround for the Swift compiler: if the Timestamp class
 * was extended directly to conform to Codable, the methods implementing the protocol would be need
 * to be marked required but that can't be done in an extension. Declaring the extension on the
 * protocol sidesteps this issue.
